                    <p>Twin Eye and his team did a fantastic job capturing all the special moments at our wedding and everything in between. I had only one request - that the photos and video be as natural as possible - and he completely honoured this request. What was even better was that everything was so relaxed - not too many staged photos! Our wedding video is one of a kind, and I have no words to describe it further. Harendra and I are ever so glad that we went ahead with Twin Eyeand we would recommend him to anyone who wants some quality work done at covering their event/s. Thank you once again for being part of our big day and capturing the essence of a fun and loving wedding! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
